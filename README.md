 Do you know about Iris flower?
Looks almost the same right? But it won't to our Machine learning algorithm.

Lets build a model and check if this flower can be predicted correctly by our ML algorithm.
First, we will import the data and pre-process and make it ready for training purpose.
Splitting the data for training and testing purpose by 80% and 20%.
After training the data, now we will predict and check how accurate the model is performing. 

For this prediction model I am using Random forest classifier. :)
